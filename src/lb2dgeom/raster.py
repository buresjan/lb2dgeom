    Rasterize a shape on the given grid.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid : Grid
        Uniform grid object defining coordinates.
    shape : Shape
        Shape object with .sdf(x,y) method.
    threshold : float, default=0.0
        Boundary threshold; Ï† <= threshold is considered solid.

    Returns
    -------
    phi : np.ndarray of shape (ny, nx), dtype=float32
        Signed distance (or level set) field sampled at cell centers.
    solid : np.ndarray of shape (ny, nx), dtype=uint8

    Classify cells as fluid, near-wall fluid, or wall (solid).

    The "near-wall" class includes fluid cells that are 8-connected neighbors

    Parameters
    ----------
    solid : np.ndarray
        Binary mask where 1 indicates wall/solid cells and 0 indicates fluid.
    fluid_code : int, optional
        Integer code to use for fluid cells. Defaults to ``0``.
    near_wall_code : int, optional
        Integer code to use for near-wall fluid cells. Defaults to ``1``.
    wall_code : int, optional
        Integer code to use for wall/solid cells. Defaults to ``2``.
